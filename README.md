# Half-Baked

Capstone gaming project for my Thinkful Node.js course.

Half baked is a two player trivia game based around a “food fight” theme. Players throw baked goods, representing trivia questions, at each other attempting to damage the other player. The player left standing is the winner.

My goal is to make this a cute, fun game to play. It have included technologies that I am learning (Node stack) and need to learn (canvas). Once finished I want to use it for my day job, as an example of the type of innovative learning games we can now deliver to our clients. 

Target devices will be desktops and possibly tablets. Mobile for phones is out of scope due to UI overhead.
